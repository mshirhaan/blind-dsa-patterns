//In this problem, even though nodes start from 1 to n, I have considered it from 0 to n-1 for ease of looping and it works.
//https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/ this is the actual premium problem which belongs to blind 75 pattern and
//this problem we solved is similar to it.
